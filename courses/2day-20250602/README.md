    during the course in the course training archive project (`/appl/local/training`).

    in `public/2day-20250602/img/LUMI-2day-20250602-*` from `DiaXX.png` to the names
    used in the notes markdown document.

-   `video-2day-20250602.sh`: Get the videos from the video processing directory on my local
    computer and put them in the right place for pushing to LUMI-O.
