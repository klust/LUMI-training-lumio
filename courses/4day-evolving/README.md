# Training materials for the 4-day course, evolving version

## Scripts

-   `process_slides_software.sh`: Change the names of the exported slides (PNG 1920x1080) 
    in `public/4day-evolving/img/LUMI-4day-evolving-software` from `DiaXX.png` to the names
    used in the notes markdown document.

## Scripts only relevant for a course itself

-   `process_4day_evolving.sh`: Download the files in the course project on LUMI to a work
    directory and build the structure for LUMI-O from them, then push to LUIMI-O.

-   `video_4day_evolving.sh`: Get the videos from the video processing directory on my local
    computer and put them in the right place for pushing to LUMI-O.
